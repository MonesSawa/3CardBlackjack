3 Card Blackjack!
A very teeny tiny micro project built by Mones Sawaftah, mainly to pass the time and keep some foundational skills fresh.

Rules are simple:
Goal is either player or dealer have to reach a value of 21. or at least be the closest to round UP to 21. any value over 21 is a BUST (loss)

you and the dealer have 3 cards each. click play to deal the cards, player gets 2 random cards, dealer gets 1 random card.
player can choose to "hit" to get an extra random card. Player can only hit once (total 3 cards!)
or the player can choose to "stand" if they feel like they will go over 21/if they are satisfied with their hand.
once the player stands or hits, the dealer's cards get revealed!

Dealer will hit/stand depending on their own cards.
Dealer will react based on the result of the game!
